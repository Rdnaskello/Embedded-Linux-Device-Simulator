## Code Style

This project uses **clang-format** and **clang-tidy** to ensure a consistent and high-quality C++ code style.

### 🔧 clang-format (Automatic Code Formatting)

The code style rules are defined in the `.clang-format` file located in the project root.

#### Format a file manually:
```bash
clang-format -i path/to/file.cpp
